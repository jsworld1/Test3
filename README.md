# Test3
Creating a new branch.
Another edit.
Repo name was changed.... "the content was edited after the push"
What happens if there is difference between the priginal file and github repo? 
It would be updated in the GitHub repo, but the system file will have original content. 
If the file in the system was not updated according to the latest version of the GitHub repo, then new push with accurate updates done latter in the system will still carry old content....that is not correct...
